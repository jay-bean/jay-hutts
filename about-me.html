							<p>A quick look into how I became a software engineer</p>

                  <h3>Backstory</h3>
                </div>
								<p>Everyone's got one, right? My story is a little different.
                  I haven't always had an unyielding enthusiasm for programming.
                  It wasn't until about a 2021 that I decided to dip my toes into the world of software.
                  I was currently in the service industry, and although the industry was good to me, I had outgrown it.
                  Around this time I had spoken with a friend who mentioned App Academy, a bootcamp for aspiring software engineers.
                  I decided right there I was going to do it. I signed up for App Academy that night and well, the rest is history.</p>

								<p>Okay I know that probably all sounds a little dramatic, but for me it was!
                   I grew up in a broken home. Because of that, I moved out at 17 and I had to put college on the back burner.
                   If you told me then that I'd become a software engineer I wouldn't think it possible.
                   Fast forward, I graduated from App Academy and no I technically didn't get a college degree, but I did receive all of the tools I need to work in this industry.
                   App Academy made this possible. The support of my significant other and friends made this possible. I made this possible. I am now a proud software engineer.</p>

								<h4>Straight and to the tech</h4>
								<p>If you skipped straight here I won't hold it against you.
                  I also jump to the recipe instead of reading the life story of the blogger who made it.</p>
                <p>At my time at App Academy I spent 1500+ hours studying and learning everything they threw at me.
                   I was drinking from the fire hose every step of the way!
                   We covered topics such as data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming, database design and architecture, RESTful APIs, frontend libraries and frameworks and test-driven development (TDD) to name a few.</p>
                <p>In that time I created four full stack web applications.
                   Two of which were group projects, and two that were solo projects.
                    During my group projects I mastered communicating effectively within a team setting, learned proper version control while working under one repository, and made some really cool projects with some really cool people!
                    The project I'm most excited about right now is my most recent solo project Drop In. It was inspired by AllTrails, but showcases skate parks instead of trails.
                    This full stack web app was written with a React frontend and Node backend.
                    The frontend leverages Redux patterns to ensure proper state management.
                    While the backend boasts Express and PostgreSQL to provide a robust API and data persistance.
                    Some other cool features include Google Maps API and AWS S3 for media storage. To learn more about Drop In click <a href="https://drop-in-skate.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoyed reading a little about myself, and hopefully we'll cross paths out there in the growing tech field.</p>
